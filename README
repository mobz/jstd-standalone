= Standlone Test Runner for JsTestDriver tests =

Allows you to run jsTestDriver tests directly in a browser

Prints a lot of interesting data into the console

Requires jstd.html to be in the same directory as jsTestDriver.conf

You must also start a server at the project root (so the server can see the src and test directories).
A customised python server is provided for this purpose

start the python server
$ pythom -m JstdServer 8100


open the test file
$ open http://localhost:8100/jstd.html
