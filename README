= Standlone Test Runner for JsTestDriver tests =

Allows you to run jsTestDriver tests directly in a browser

Prints a lot of interesting data into the console

Requires jstd.html to be in the same directory as jsTestDriver.conf

If you are not using an external assert library like hamcrest, you will need to include the Assert.js from jstestdriver source
This is in the support directory. Simply creating a link tag in jstd.html should be sufficient.

You must also start a server at the project root (so the server can see the src and test directories).
A customised python server is provided for this purpose

start the python server
$ python -m JstdServer 8100


open the test file
$ open http://localhost:8100/jstd.html
